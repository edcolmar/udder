# Delete the OPC layout JSON file, then regenerate a new one on the basis of
# the current patch sheet given in your properties file. After regenerating the
# layout, Udder will quit.
#
# This example uses the bundled jar to accomplish this task. If you are actively
# hacking the patch sheet interpreter or the OPC layout JSON generator, then you
# should write your own script to run your modified Udder from its build
# location.
#
# Don't edit the layout file. Edit your patch sheet, then let Udder generate the
# layout file, or you'll lose your changes.
#
# You don't need a layout file unless you're using the OPC gl_server as a
# monitor.
